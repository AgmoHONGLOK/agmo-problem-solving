# Situation:\
The Agmo Energy team recently released version v1.0.4 of the PowerEnergy App to address critical login issues. A remote config setting was applied to enforce a mandatory update for all users to this latest version.

However, reports have surfaced that some users are not receiving the force update prompt and are still able to use the outdated version, bypassing the intended enforcement.

# Task:\
You're brought in as a senior mobile engineer to quickly investigate, identify the root cause, and resolve this issue. The resolution must be done urgently, as the login bug in older versions affects core functionality.

# User information:\
- app version: 1.0.2\
- device: Samsung Galaxy Fold, Android 15\\

# Remote config settings:\
- forceUpdateVersion: 1.0.4\
- optionalUpdateVersion: 1.0.3\
- forceUpdateMessage: "Please update your app now to continue enjoy the services."\
- optionalVersionUpdateMessage: "There is new version available, would you like to update now?"\
