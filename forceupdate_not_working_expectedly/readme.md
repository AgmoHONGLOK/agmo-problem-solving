# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Investigation Task: Force Update Not Triggering

## üìñ Situation

The **Agmo Energy** team recently released version `v1.0.4` of the **PowerEnergy App** to fix a critical login issue. To ensure all users receive this fix, a **Remote Config** setting was deployed to **enforce a mandatory update** to version `1.0.4`.

Despite this, some users have reported that they **did not receive the force update prompt** and are still able to use older versions like `1.0.2`, effectively **bypassing the update enforcement**. This is a high-priority issue, as older versions contain a login bug that affects core functionality.
